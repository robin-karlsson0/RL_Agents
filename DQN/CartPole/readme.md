# DQN Algorithm (CartPole)

DQN algorithm working on CartPole.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Dependencies

* TensorFlow
* OpenAI Gym

## Running the tests

Running 'agent_DQN.py' produces a result file called 'rew_new.dat'. The algorithm can be validated by comparing the results inside 'rew_orig.dat' produced by the original (mutilated) Udacity DQN agent.
